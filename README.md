💁 Project Summary

In this project, we learn how to start working on our own API. How to conceptualize and design the architecture of our API (including requests and responses), as well as what kind of information (if any) we need to include in our request and response bodies. We then walked through an example API, exploring a few new Express features such as request parameters, the body-parser and uuid modules, and status codes, all before looking at how we can test our URL endpoints via API development tools like Postman.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install movie_api5 --save

## Scenario

As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.

As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

    * creating an error handling function (bodyParser was not installed)
    
* movie_api2
    * no change
    
* movie_api3
    * assigning express in index.js file
